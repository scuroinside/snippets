# Snippets
A collection of useful (or useless) snippets for lua and GLua.
All attached scripts are developed by me and are distributed under the MIT license.
Cheapblur, Netvar, Task, Navmesh, PData scripts are part of ASGLib for Garry's mod.
I don't see the need for supporting documentation. If you think that any of these scripts are necessary for you, you will understand how it works.
